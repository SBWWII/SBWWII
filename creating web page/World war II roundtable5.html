Write HTML code for a webpage with the heading 'World War II Roundtable', set the background color to sky blue, and position three boxes evenly across the center of the page. One box should contain an <img src="C:/users/gdelz/onedrive/Pictures/images/democracy.jpeg">, another should have an <img src="C:/users/gdelz/onedrive/Pictures/images/berlin.jpeg">, and the last one should display an <img src="C:/users/gdelz/onedrive/Pictures/images/tokyo.jpeg">. Below the images, include the text "Sign Up to Join," and beneath that, create a sign-up form requesting the name, email address, and cell phone number.
