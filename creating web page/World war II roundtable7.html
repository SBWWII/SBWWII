One box should contain an <img src= "images/democracy.jpeg">, another should have an <img src="images/berlin.jpeg">, and the last one should display an <img src="images/tokyo.jpeg">. Below the images, include the text "Sign Up to Join," and beneath that, create a sign-up form requesting the name, email address, and cell phone number.
